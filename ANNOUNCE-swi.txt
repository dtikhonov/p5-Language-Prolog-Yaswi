Hello,

I have released Language::Prolog::Yaswi, a Perl module that
implements a bidirectional interface between Perl and
SWI-Prolog.

It's a high level interface providing:

1.- automatic data conversion between both languages:

  prolog atoms, numbers, lists, etc are transparently
  converted to perl scalars, arrays, etc. and the other way
  when crossing the interface.


2.- no maintenance tasks to be performed by the programmer:

  all the resource allocation/deallocation, is performed
  without any intervention from the programmer.


3.- Perl object system available from prolog

  perl objects can be referenced from prolog and their
  methods called. This also means that most modules in the
  CPAN can be used from prolog with little effort.


I have uploaded the module to CPAN (it could take some time
to reach all its mirrors).

If a full perl installation is available in your system it
can be easily installed with the CPAN module:

  root@cabo:~# perl -MCPAN -eshell
  cpan> install Language::Prolog::Yaswi

if that doesn't work, then you would have to manually
download the package from

http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/S/SA/SALVA/Language-Prolog-Yaswi-0.02.tar.gz

and follow the instructions in the README file (note that
some other packages would be required).

After installation the programming instructions can be read
running

  salva@cabo:~$ perldoc Language::Prolog::Yaswi



This is a very early release, bugs should be expected.

Threads are not supported yet

It has not been tested on Windows



Comments, suggestions, bug reports, etc. are welcome

Bye,

- Salva.



BTW, The CPAN is the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network, an
impressive repository of freely available perl modules. Take
a look at http://www.cpan.org/ or at its more user friendly
interface http://search.cpan.org/ .
